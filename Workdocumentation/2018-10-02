Today we worked on our chatbot-application. 
We refined certain elements in it and added some helpful comments, 
aswell as file descritpitons. 
Additionally, we created a class-diagram for the chatbot application. 
In this repository, we added some delegation-examples for you to take a look at. 
There are also additional uml-diagrams for them. 
We could finish our planned tasks: We finished the ChatBot and created diagrams for most of our applications.
